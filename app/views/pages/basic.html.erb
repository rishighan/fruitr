	<h3>Welcome to Fruitr</h3><br/>
	<p> I have embarked on a quest to substantiate the <code>hotttnesss</code> rating that Echonest applies to musical artists. There is no documentation on how it is calculated. What I am attempting here, is the first step in that quest.
	</p>
	
	<p>Enter an artist name as a seed value. You will see a list of <code>similar</code> artists in decreasing order of similarity. I also retrieve the <code>familiarity</code> and <code>hotttnesss</code> ratings for these artists. Then I calculate the Pearson product-moment coefficient of correlation for this sample size.</p>
	
	<p>The idea: If there is a strong correlation between <code>hotttnesss</code> and <code>familiarity</code> for a substantial number of data sets, then we can conclude that <code>familiarity</code> plays a role in calculating <code>hotttnesss</code> or vice versa. Here we go!</p>
