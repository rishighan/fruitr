Fruitr is an experiment with the Echonest API.

It is an exposition of the idea stated here: http://www.rishighan.com/thesis/

The initial idea calculates the Pearson product-moment coefficient of correlation between the hotttnesss and familiarity ratings retrieved from Echonest. This helps to add a layer of verification on top of the numerical ratings that Echonest applies to intangible concepts such as how 'hot' an artist is.

As I build upon the idea, I am also creating a Ruby wrapper around most of the Echonest API hooks.
